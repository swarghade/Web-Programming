        <h1>Almost deported at Newark Airport</h1>
        <p>It was our first time in traveling away from India. While offboarding the plane, my friends bag got replaced with a fellow traveller and he had no clue regarding it, as they both had same bag.</p>
        <p>ICE asked him for his documents and then he found the bag was not opening as it was not his bag. He was taken to this room where illegal travelers were brought to be deported back. He somehow managed to convince them and showed his documents stored in pdf format.</p>
        <p>They had to run an announcement to find out that other person who had taken his bag.</p>
